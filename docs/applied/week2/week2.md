# Week 2 Applied Class Material

> The exercises are designed for students to finish in an individual capacity. The exercises are not designed to be completed in tutorial sessions but rather to give you some tasks and a starting point to continue and complete on your own.


## Lab Overview

Public key cryptography is the foundation of todayâ€™s secure communication, but it is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks when one side of communication sends its public key to the other side. The fundamental problem is that there is no easy way to verify the ownership of a public key, i.e., given a public key and its claimed owner information, how do we ensure that the public key is indeed owned by the claimed owner? The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a practical solution to this problem. The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on PKI. By doing the tasks in this lab, students should be able to gain a better understanding of how PKI works, how PKI is used to protect the Web, and how Man-in-the-middle attacks can be defeated by PKI. Moreover, students will be able to understand the root of the trust in the public-key infrastructure, and what problems will arise if the root trust is broken.
